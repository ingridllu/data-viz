      <h4>Analysis/Additional info</h4>
    <p>The first visualization represents how fertility rates have changed in the world's countries from 1990 to 2020. From sliding the slider, it can be seen how fertility rates as a whole have decreased in the last 30 years. The average world fertility rate is about 2.3, the lowest it has ever been. Although this number is high enough to sustain and grow our population, when looking at individual countries, we see many battling record-breaking lows. A nation is estimated to need a fertility rate of about 2.1 to sustain its population. When looking at South Korea and the U.S. specifically, we see both countries with numbers not large enough to maintain the population size. 
</p>
      <p>South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world, at .78 births per woman. South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world, at .78 births per woman. Many factors, like marriage rates, housing prices, and work culture, can explain this. According to the last ten years of available data, marriage rates are down more than 35% because South Koreans prioritize work over starting a family. A big reason for this is how the price of living and specifically housing prices, have increased. This price hike means a worker in Seoul with a yearly income of 36 million won, equivalent to about 27,000 USD, will take 36 years to purchase an apartment in the city, double the 18 years it would have taken in 2004. Work culture or “workism” in South Korea has grown very severe, and many women are unwilling to have children because it would cause them to miss work for months, risking their positions and the hard-earned respect they have in their workplaces. This severe decrease in fertility rate will negatively affect their economy because it will cause a high number of elderly people with a low number of young people to support the workforce and the economy.
</p>
      <p>The United States fertility rate is also at a record-breaking low, at 1.64 births per woman. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2034, people 65 and older will outnumber those under 18 for the first time in U.S. history. Although this number alone is too low to maintain our population, because of high immigration rates, our population size is still growing. Our low birth rate is also directly related to work culture and more women in the workforce. It is said that having a first child at an older age has been associated with a positive impact on a woman’s wages and career path.
